# Macintosh-AMA-Project
The MAMA or Macintosh Ask Me Anything is a game project that aims to entertain you when you're bored. Just kidding, nothing as boring as this could ever entertain you! Just go back to playing fortnite. Almost all artwork is made by me, except for Tux, I do not claim the tux logo as my property.

# Dependencies
Install colorama module, install OS module, install image2console module, install subprocess module, and install time module or just install it with the requirements.txt
